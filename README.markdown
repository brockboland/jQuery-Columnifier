In the summer of 2010, I was curious if I could use jQuery to overflow text into multiple columns that would dynamically re-flow as the page was resized. This got part way there, but I never finished it

Today, I came across a jQuery plugin that goes exactly what I had set out to doâ€”except, you know, someone finished it: http://welcome.totheinter.net/columnizer-jquery-plugin/

I'm leaving this project here because it was fun to work on, but it won't see any updates.
